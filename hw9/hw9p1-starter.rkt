; == Homework 9, Problem 1 ==

; We are going to continue working towards the project, designing several common
; functions for analyzing a text based upon the occurrence of words.

; Some parts will reference work you did in prior homework assignments - you may
; use your own solutions to those (ideally with any corrections from grading
; feedback) or the sample solutions on the course website.

; Unless otherwise specified in the problem, you should make appropriate use of
; list abstractions and local/lambda.

; TODO #1: design the abstraction read-from-file-with-invalid, which checks if a
; file exists (returning an empty list if it does not) and otherwise calls a
; supplied function to return a list of strings. Use this function to design
; read-words-from-file (where the list of strings is each word in the file)
; and read-lines-as-strings-from-file (where the list is each line in the file).
; Finally, design the function read-lines-as-nums-from-file, which produces
; a list of numbers, assuming every line in a file can be converted to a number.
; Some tests have been provided for clarity.

; - One good approach to this problem is to consider each element in the supplied
